# LaLiga_EDA_Manipulation
Here we have past years of data of teams participating in LaLiga with this use-case we try to identify winner or potential winner for upcoming league based on the past track record of teams.
We have data of around 61 teams which have participated in the league over the years, so initially we load the dataset using pandas and identify various features available that would help us in getting the results. So we start with cleaning of dataset and converting the required columns in workable format as per the need and perform various manipulation operation.
